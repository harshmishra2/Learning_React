Props are how we pass data from one component to another.  <component1/> ------------> <compnent2/>
They allow components to be dynamic and reusable.
Props is a js object when being passed as a parameter in the function (Welcome in this case). Take your prop and pass value to it which will be done in the app.jsx.
Use curly braces to put javaScript in it give it keys and values. 


Welcome.jsx

function Welcome(props){
return(
  <h1>
    Welcome {props.name}
  <h1/>);
}
export default Welcome;


App.jsx

import "React" from react;
import "Welcome" from "./components/Welcome"

const App = () = > {
  return (
  <div>
    <Welcome name = "Learn React" />
    <Welcome name = "Harsh" />
  <div/>
  );
};
export default App;


The output result on (like the one on the localhost will be):

Welcome Learn React
Welcome Harsh
